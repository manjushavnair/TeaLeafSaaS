# This is mainly for debugging puroses. When using the Selenium 2 WebDriver 
# implementation of Wte, you can manually set extra "capabilities" sent to the 
# WebDriver when initializing it. Specify capabilities in the following format:
#   <key1>=<value1>;<key2>=<value2>;...
#
# The value will first be treated as a boolean if it is either "true" or 
# "false", and then as a string. Please note that this property is limited to 
# boolean and string values, so Objects values cannot be used. Any value here
# will attempt to override the same value set internally.
#
# See Selenium's org.openqa.selenium.remote.CapabilityType class for details. 
#
# The default is not to set any capabilities if commented out.
